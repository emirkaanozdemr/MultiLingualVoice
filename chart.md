# MultiLingualVoice UML Class Diagram

MultiLingualVoice is an innovative application designed to bridge language barriers by capturing spoken words and rendering them in different languages. This tool empowers users to communicate effortlessly across diverse languages by transforming their spoken expressions into translated, high-quality audio in their desired language.

```mermaid

    class User {
        +String name
        +speak()
    }

    class AudioCapture {
        +String audioData
        +captureAudio()
    }

    class LanguageProcessor {
        +String sourceLanguage
        +String targetLanguage
        +String translatedText
        +processAudio(audioData)
        +translate(text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage)
    }

    class AudioRenderer {
        +String translatedAudio
        +renderAudio(translatedText, targetLanguage)
    }

    User --> AudioCapture : speaks
    AudioCapture --> LanguageProcessor : sends audio data
    LanguageProcessor --> AudioRenderer : sends translated text
    AudioRenderer --> User : delivers translated audio

### Explanation

1. **User**: Represents the user of the application. The user initiates the speech.
2. **AudioCapture**: Captures the user's speech and stores it as audio data.
3. **LanguageProcessor**: Processes the captured audio data, detects the source language, translates it to the desired language, and stores it as text.
4. **AudioRenderer**: Converts the translated text into high-quality spoken audio and delivers it back to the user.

This diagram visually represents the core functionality and the relationships between the components of the MultiLingualVoice application. You can add this Markdown content to a file and upload it to GitHub, where GitHub will automatically render the Mermaid code and display the diagram.
