        +speak()
    }

    class AudioCapture {
        +String audioData
        +captureAudio()
    }

    class LanguageProcessor {
        +String sourceLanguage
        +String targetLanguage
        +String translatedText
        +processAudio(audioData)
        +translate(text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage)
    }

    class AudioRenderer {
        +String translatedAudio
        +renderAudio(translatedText, targetLanguage)
    }

    User --> AudioCapture : speaks
    AudioCapture --> LanguageProcessor : sends audio data
    LanguageProcessor --> AudioRenderer : sends translated text
    AudioRenderer --> User : delivers translated audio
